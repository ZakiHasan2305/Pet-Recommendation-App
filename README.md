# Pet Recommendation App
Developed a user-friendly web-based interface using React.js and Node.js for a Pet Recommendation System. Implemented a comprehensive recommendation logic based on user preferences and pet attributes, ensuring fair and personalized suggestions. Overcame challenges by addressing recurring pet entries through a script and optimizing performance by selectively curating a diverse set of pets from the Petfinder API.
